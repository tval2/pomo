Pomo is a friendly, [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)-powered assistant, inspired by [Project Astra](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/project-astra/).  Pomo uses your camera and microphone to understand the world around you and can respond to your voice to answer questions and hold conversations.

Pomo can also take on the role of any object using Augmented Reality.  Simply click on something and Pomo will anthropomorphize it and respond as that object.

Pomo is currently available as a web app.  For more info, see [pomo-web](https://github.com/tval2/pomo/tree/main/pomo-web).
